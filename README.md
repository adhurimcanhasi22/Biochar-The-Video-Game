# Biochar-The-Video-Game

The Video Game is an educational game designed to teach players about the process of creating biocharâ€”a method for carbon sequestration and soil improvement. Through interactive gameplay, players learn each step involved in biochar production, from gathering materials to processing them, all while understanding the environmental benefits.

This game was created as a final project during my Erasmus exchange program in Leoben, Austria. The goal was to make learning about biochar accessible and engaging, especially for students and anyone interested in sustainable practices.
